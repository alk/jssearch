This is some problem solving JS code I've started writing some time
ago. Some very basic things work (DFS and BFS). But initial plan was
to reach more advanced algorithms. And in fact looking at code I've
started doing Alpha* search.

Some day I'll hopefully complete this code. And because the code looks
OK and I have nothing to hide I decided to publish it early. It may be
of use for somebody or it may inspire more experimentation.

Credit for (implicitly) encouraging me to publish this goes to Mihai
Bazon. Particularly, his blog post about amb() operator implementation
in JS. (http://mihai.bazon.net/blog/amb-in-javascript)
